# Root vascular symmetry
 Boundary quantification and vertex model code for root vascular symmetry in [論文名]。Description of the contents of each folder.
 1.	boundary quantification
We determined each position of the tricellular junctions in the root vascular tissue at the transverse section of the proliferation zone using the Fiji plugin Tissue Analyzer.
<br>Symmetry is calculated by boundary_symmetry.xlsx.
<br>Roughness is calculated by boundary_roughness.xlsx.
<br>Angle is calculated by boundary_angle.xlsx.
<br>Aspect ratio is calculated by Fiji plugin Tissue Analyzer.
2.	vertex model
Initial cell position data set is written in initial_cell_position folder.
<br>Calculation 
<br>C++:cellform_vascul_growth.cpp
<br>Visualize
<br>Processing:sketch_vascul_sim.pde
